# Template Editing Ideas (Solo Intermediate User)

- Inline edits: change sets/reps/weights directly in the session view (no modal), with shortcuts (`enter` add set, `shift+enter` add exercise, `/` search exercises).
- Safe-but-fast changes: quick-clone a template, edit, and “apply to session now” without touching the original; lightweight version history to undo.
- Smarter defaults: remember per-exercise preferred weight/reps/rest and auto-fill; “adjust to today” slider scales volume up or down 10–20% across the session.
- Fast structure edits: drag/drop exercises and blocks; reusable blocks for warmup, hinge ladders, and finishers.
- Context-aware helpers: suggest the set schemes you use most (e.g., 5x5 @ 24kg, 10:00 EMOM swings @ 16kg); quick EMOM/AMRAP toggle with built-in timer/haptics.
- Immediate feedback: live volume/tonnage and estimated RPE impact while editing to avoid overshooting.
- Extras worth considering: offline-friendly cache so edits survive bad connections; CSV import/export for templates; “today vs base template” diff with one-click save-back.

Follow-up: are you mostly editing/logging on mobile or desktop? That will guide shortcut choices and layout.
