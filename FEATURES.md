# Bell Track - Development Features

## Current Sprint: Exercise Library Foundation

### ðŸš€ Feature 1: Exercise Library CRUD
**Status**: Ready to Start
**Priority**: P0 (Foundational)

**Description**: Build the core exercise management system where users can create, view, and delete kettlebell exercises with type classification.

**Technical Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up Prisma schema for Exercise model
- [ ] Create tRPC procedures: `exercise.getAll()`, `exercise.create()`, `exercise.delete()`
- [ ] Build exercise form component (name, description, muscle groups, type)
- [ ] Create exercise list/grid view
- [ ] Add basic validation and error handling

**Database Schema**:
```prisma
model Exercise {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  name          String
  description   String?
  muscleGroups  String[] // ["legs", "shoulders", "core"]
  equipment     String   @default("kettlebell")
  type          String   // "exercise" | "complex"
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

**Learning Goals**:
- Prisma schema design and migrations
- tRPC procedure creation and type safety
- React Query integration with tRPC
- Form handling in Next.js App Router
